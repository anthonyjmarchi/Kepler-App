# Kepler Age Calculator
## An app that calculates the age at which a user should stop dating using Optimal Stopping Theory principles.

I was inspired to create this app after reading about Optimal Stopping Theory in the book Algorithms to Live By.  The app asks users for two inputs:  The age at which they started dating, and the age at which they would like to be married.  Using theose two variables, the app applies the 37% rule to the difference and outputs an age.  This age is the age that, according to optimal stopping theory, a person should settle with the next person who has beeen better than all the previous people they have dated.  Basically, they should stop dating when they find someone better than all the previous people they have dated.

They app is written in React Native and was tested on iOS using Expo.
